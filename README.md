Readable is a Next.js application that personalizes research paper summaries and tutoring. It now integrates a managed Weaviate instance for hybrid retrieval over paper chunks, figures, citations, and persona concepts.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Once your environment variables are in place (see below), you can validate the Weaviate connection and schema with:

```bash
pnpm test:weaviate
```

This script checks liveness/ready status, ensures the hybrid schema, and runs a smoke hybrid query.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values before running the app:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

At minimum you should provide values for:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `WEAVIATE_URL`
- `WEAVIATE_API_KEY`
- `POSTHOG_KEY`
- `KONTEXT_API_KEY`
- `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_KEY`

Additional variables:

- `WEAVIATE_TIMEOUT_MS` (optional) â€” override the default 20s health-check timeout for managed clusters.
